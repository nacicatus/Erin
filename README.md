Erin - Erlang Switcher Script

This applescript returns a list of Erlang versions installed by Homebrew and presents a choice to switch versions. It then opens an erl shell with the chosen version.

Future Improvements:
1. To check if Homebrew is installed
2. To present an option to install / upgrade current version
3. To highlight current version
